## Getting Started

* It's assumed that your AWS credentials are stored locally. The simplest path forward there
would be to install the AWS CLI tool and running `aws configure`.
* Ensure that the [resources for the remote backend](scripts/remote-state) have been created. They have.

## Notes

* Resources should be created in the `us-east-2` region
